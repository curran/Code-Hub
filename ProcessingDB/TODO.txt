Future Feature Ideas
 - Make run link work with code currently in the editor, not the saved code
 - add CTRL+R shortcut for running
 - add CTRL+S shortcut for saving
 - @inGallery descriptionString //Publishes this app to the ProcessingDB gallery
 - Have a "ProcessingDB Gallery" with thumbnails of the running code
 - @language coffeescript
 - @language markdown
   - @documents foo //declares that this script is documentation for module or template 'foo'
     - Place 'documentation' link below 'foo' code in editor
     - Place 'documents foo' link below documentation code in editor
 - Autocomplete when typing require(... via AJAX request to list modules starting with ...
 - Autocomplete when typing foo.X where previously 'foo = require('foo')' was found
   - X is extracted from 'exports.X = ...' in 'foo' module
 - Documentation extracted and placed as a tooltip next to autocomplete for foo.X
 - Integrate ASH
 - Feedback button
   - Comments can be posted giving feedback on ProcessingDB itself
   - Comments can be viewed in blog style at processingdb.org/feedback
 - Add search (searching names and content)
   - results in sections: 
     - Modules
